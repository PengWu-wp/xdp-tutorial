This test uses intel x550T NIC which support XDP_DRV_MODE.
Two ports are used:
  - Port0 is bound by DPDK, using Pktgen to send packets.
  - Port1 attach my XDP porg of a simple firewall (only drop by IP).
Pktgen tool can be found in [[https://github.com/sdnfv/openNetVM/tree/master/tools/Pktgen][here]].
I have no idea which tool can show how many pkts are droped by my XDP prog. So I count in my XDP prog and save it to my map (key = 1).
Map ID needs to be changed before you run it.
It's a long way to go.
